# TarkovLoadout

This is a MVP for a loadout builder for the PC game Escape from Tarkov built in React Native using class based React.
The goal of the project was to create a mobile app that would allow a players to easily compare different equipment options and full loadout sets in an easy to use interface.
An emphasis was placed on using color to illustrate every statistic's ranking percentile wise relative to other options.
The colors were ranked as follows:
Black - Red - Orange - Yellow - Green - Blue - Purple

This MVP app was originally intended for Escape from Tarkov version 0.10 (Late 2019) and is thus depreciated.

This is a link to a brief demo of its first test.
